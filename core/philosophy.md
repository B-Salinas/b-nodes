The idea behind b-nodes starts with me: B, short for Bianca (someone once asked me, "what's the b stand for? Be careful?").

But more importantly - **_baiulus_**: porter, pall-bearer, carrier of a burden. It seemed only fitting as we are all bearers of existence, being alive first-handedly.

b-nodes is about being, and embodying just **be**-ing.
