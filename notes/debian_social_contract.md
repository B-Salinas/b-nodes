# Debian's "Social Contract" With The Free Software Community

We are Software In The Public Interest, producers of the Debian GNU/Linux system. This is the "social contract" we offer to the free software community. 

### 1. Debian Will Remain 100% Free Software
We promise to keep the Debian GNU/Linux Distribution entirely free software. As there are many definitions of free software, we include the guidelines we use to determine if software is "free" below. We will support our users who develop and run non-free software on Debian, but we will never make the system depend on an item of non-free software.
