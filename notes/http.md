# Basics
**HTTP** = HyperText Transfer Protocol   
* _HyperText_ = content with reference to other content (text, images, videos, or any other digital content)  
  * references between hypertexts recourses are called hyperlinks or just links.
* _Transfer Protocol_ = a set of guidelines/process of exchanging data, but doesn't define what that data might be.

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a request/response protocol. An HTTP exchange is more like a series of distinct   questions and answers than a conversation between two systems. 

**The ability to link pages/massive collections together for interactivity is what makes everything possible!**

---

HTTP defines the process of exchanging hypertext between systems and works between clients and servers. 
* _Clients_ or user agent = the data consumer (your browser)
* _Servers_ or origin = the data provider, often where an application is running

In a typical exchange, the client sends a request to the server for a particular resource - a webpage, image, or application data - and the server provides a response containing either the resource that the client requested or an explanation of why it can't provide the resource. 

You ask the server a simple yes/no question and it responds accordingly.
